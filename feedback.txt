Feedback
--------

your abstract design, concurrency strategy, testing strategy, the way you reported the results of manual testing, code organization, code presentation all were well done. 
though your design document can do better in terms of content organization and clarity. 
in your code, you made a clear distinction between listeners(controllers) views(gui) and model classes by your naming convention. good job there too.

the only point you lost is for the login error messages, they were not prominent enough. you could use a different color or a bigger text to attract attention. 
I gave you bonus points for: 
1) emoticons 
2) avatars
3) your chat window shows when other participants are typing. 
4) clients can select multiple clients for a group chat.
