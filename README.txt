Steps to run our GUIChat program:
1) Start the Server by running Server.main. By default, the server runs on port 4567.
2) Start any number of Clients by running Client.main. The IP address and port to which the client connects can be changed in the first window of the client. Submit "localhost" as the IP address and "4567" as the port to connect to a server run locally with the default settings. These values should already appear in the first window as default values.

Special features:
Try using emoticons. Generic smileys will automatically turn into animated emoticons. Also, a writing a colon before an animal name may generate that animal as an emoticon. For example, ":horse" will create a horse emoticon. The list of emoticons can be found in Emoticon.java.
