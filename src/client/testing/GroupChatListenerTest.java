/**
 * Manual Testing:
 * All testing for the GroupChatListenerTest class will be done manually. We will create
 * an instance of a GroupChatListener (by clicking the "Group Chat" button from the
 * ChatClient) and then test that it functions property. We will check that:
 *     - Clicking on a username changes the color to LIGHT_BLUE if it is black
 *     - Clicking on a username changes the color to black if it is LIGHT_BLUE
 *     - Hovering over a username will change the color to LIGHT_BLUE
 *     - Leaving the username will change the color back to black (if it was not
 *       LIGHT_BLUE before hovering)
 *     - Pressing the mouse (without releasing over that username) should have no effect
 *     - Releasing the mouse (without having pressed over that username) should have no effect
