/**
 * Manual Testing:
 * Testing for the UserListener class will be done manually. To do so involves
 * creating a ChatClient GUI and making sure that following effects occur:
 *    - Hovering over a username changes the color of the username to blue
 *    - Leaving the username changes to color of the username back to black
 *    - Clicking on the username results in a new ChatBox being opened
 *    - Pressing on a username (without releasing) has no effect
 *    - Releasing over a username (without having pressed there) has no effect
 *
